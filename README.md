# Expense Reimbursement System
**Project 1**

**Expense Reimbursement**

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

**Roles / Responsibilities**

- Stored the data in the server using AWS RDS database.
- Created custom views and procedures for the database using DBeaver.
- Used Java DAOs using custom queries as needed and abstracted business logic into separate service layer.
